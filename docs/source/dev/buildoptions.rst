Build Options
=============

.. sectionauthor:: Axel Huebl

Variants
--------

The following options can be added to the ``cmake`` call to control features.
CMake controls options with prefixed ``-D``, e.g. ``-DopenPMD_USE_MPI=OFF``:

============================== =============== ========================================================================
CMake Option                   Values          Description
============================== =============== ========================================================================
``openPMD_USE_MPI``            **AUTO**/ON/OFF Parallel, Multi-Node I/O for clusters
``openPMD_USE_JSON``           **AUTO**/ON/OFF JSON backend (``.json`` files)
``openPMD_USE_HDF5``           **AUTO**/ON/OFF HDF5 backend (``.h5`` files)
``openPMD_USE_ADIOS1``         **AUTO**/ON/OFF ADIOS1 backend (``.bp`` files)
``openPMD_USE_ADIOS2``         **AUTO**/ON/OFF ADIOS2 backend (``.bp`` files)
``openPMD_USE_PYTHON``         **AUTO**/ON/OFF Enable Python bindings
``openPMD_USE_INVASIVE_TESTS`` ON/**OFF**      Enable unit tests that modify source code :sup:`1`
``openPMD_USE_VERIFY``         **ON**/OFF      Enable internal VERIFY (assert) macro independent of build type :sup:`2`
``PYTHON_EXECUTABLE``          (first found)   Path to Python executable
============================== =============== ========================================================================

:sup:`1` e.g. changes C++ visibility keywords, breaks MSVC

:sup:`2` this includes most pre-/post-condition checks, disabling without specific cause is highly discouraged


Shared or Static
----------------

By default, we will build as a shared library and install also its headers.
You can only build a static (``libopenPMD.a`` or ``openPMD.lib``) or a shared library (``libopenPMD.so`` or ``openPMD.dylib`` or ``openPMD.dll``) at a time.

The following options switch between static and shared builds and control if dependencies are linked dynamically or statically:

============================== =============== ==================================================
CMake Option                   Values          Description
============================== =============== ==================================================
``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``          **ON**/OFF      Build the C++ API as shared library
``HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES``  ON/**OFF**      Require static HDF5 library
``ADIOS_USE_STATIC_LIBS``      ON/**OFF**      Require static ADIOS1 library
============================== =============== ==================================================

Note that python modules (``openpmd_api.cpython.[...].so`` or ``openpmd_api.pyd``) are always dynamic libraries.
Therefore, if you want to build the python module and prefer static dependencies, make sure to provide all of dependencies build with position independent code (``-fPIC``).
The same requirement is true if you want to build a *shared* C++ API library with *static* dependencies.


Debug
-----

By default, the ``Release`` version is built.
In order to build with debug symbols, pass ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` to your ``cmake`` command.


Shipped Dependencies
--------------------

Additionally, the following libraries are shipped internally for convenience.
These might get installed in your :ref:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX <install-cmake>` if the option is ``ON``.

The following options allow to switch to external installs of dependencies:

================================= =========== ======== ============= ========
CMake Option                      Values      Installs Library       Version
================================= =========== ======== ============= ========
``openPMD_USE_INTERNAL_VARIANT``  **ON**/OFF  Yes      MPark.Variant   1.4.0+
``openPMD_USE_INTERNAL_CATCH``    **ON**/OFF  No       Catch2          2.6.1+
``openPMD_USE_INTERNAL_PYBIND11`` **ON**/OFF  No       pybind11        2.2.4+
``openPMD_USE_INTERNAL_JSON``     **ON**/OFF  No       NLohmann-JSON   3.5.0+
================================= =========== ======== ============= ========


Tests
-----

By default, tests and examples are built.
In order to skip building those, pass ``-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`` or ``-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF`` to your ``cmake`` command.
