Backend-Specific Configuration
==============================

While the openPMD API intends to be a backend-*independent* implementation of the openPMD standard, it is sometimes useful to pass configuration parameters to the specific backend in use.
:ref:`For each backend <backends-overview>`, configuration options can be passed via a JSON-formatted string or via environment variables.
A JSON option always takes precedence over an environment variable.

The fundamental structure of this JSON configuration string is given as follows:

.. literalinclude:: config_layout.json
   :language: json

This structure allows keeping one configuration string for several backends at once, with the concrete backend configuration being chosen upon choosing the backend itself.

The configuration is read in a case-sensitive manner.
Generally, keys of the configuration are *lower case*.
Parameters that are directly passed through to an external library and not interpreted within openPMD API (e.g. ``adios2.engine.parameters``) are unaffected by this and follow the respective library's conventions.

The configuration string may refer to the complete ``openPMD::Series`` or may additionally be specified per ``openPMD::Dataset``, passed in the respective constructors.
*A configuration per dataset is currently not yet implemented.*
This reflects the fact that certain backend-specific parameters may refer to the whole Series (such as storage engines and their parameters) and others refer to actual datasets (such as compression).

For a consistent user interface, backends shall follow the following rules:

* The configuration structures for the Series and for each dataset should be defined equivalently.
* Any setting referring to single datasets should also be applicable globally, affecting all datasets.
* If a setting is defined globally, but also for a concrete dataset, the dataset-specific setting should override the global one.
* If a setting is passed to a dataset that only makes sense globally (such as the storage engine), the setting should be ignored except for printing a warning.
  Backends should define clearly which keys are applicable to datasets and which are not.


Configuration Structure per Backend
-----------------------------------

ADIOS2
^^^^^^

A full configuration of the ADIOS2 backend:

.. literalinclude:: adios2.json
   :language: json

All keys found under ``adios2.dataset`` are applicable globally as well as per dataset, keys found under ``adios2.engine`` only globally.
Explanation of the single keys:

* ``adios2.engine.type``: A string that is passed directly to ``adios2::IO:::SetEngine`` for choosing the ADIOS2 engine to be used.
  Please refer to the `official ADIOS2 documentation <https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engines/engines.html>`_ for a list of available engines.
* ``adios2.engine.parameters``: An associative array of string-formatted engine parameters, passed directly through to ``adios2::IO::SetParameters``.
  Please refer to the official ADIOS2 documentation for the allowable engine parameters.
* ``adios2.engine.usesteps``: Described more closely in the documentation for the :ref:`ADIOS2 backend<backends-adios2>`.
* ``adios2.dataset.operators``: (*currently unimplemented* â€“ please use the ``openPMD::Dataset::compression`` for the meantime) This key contains a list of ADIOS2 `operators <https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/components.html#operator>`_, used to enable compression or dataset transformations.
  Each object in the list has three keys:

  * ``type`` supported ADIOS operator type, e.g. zfp, sz
  * ``parameters`` is an associative map of string parameters for the operator (e.g. compression levels)

Other backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do currently not read the configuration string.
Please refer to the respective backends' documentations for further information on their configuration.
